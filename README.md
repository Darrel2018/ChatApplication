# ChatApplication
This is my first attempt to create a chat application


# The Application

1. This Application localhosts off the users pc
2. This Application can only hold up to two clients (due to my limited knowledge on datagram socket programming)

# How to use

1. First compile and run the ServerBoot java file
2. Second compile and run the ClientBoot java file twice
3. Now click on the "Start Server" button to boot the server application
4. Then, on both clients click on the "Start Client" button

The two Clients should now be able to communicate with each other.

Use the textField to the left of the "Submit" button to enter text
then press the "Submit" button to send the message.
